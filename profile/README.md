# Feel Covid
The organization incorporates various repositories employed in maintaining feel.co.il. The website was established at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting reports from Israel's Ministry of Health in a user-friendly and convenient manner. 

# Repositories
* **feel-covid-db**: Contains the data collected until November 2021.
 
* **feel-covid-frontend**: Contains the frontend code for feel.co.il.

* **feel-covid-moh-data-collector**: Contains a telegram bot that samples Israel's MOH and notifies when changes are detected. The bot generates a link that points to `feel-covid-publisher` with all the necessary data to populate the form. Also contains an API to publish daily datapoints to `feel-covid-backend`.

* **feel-covid-backend**: Contains the backend code for feel.co.il.

* **feel-covid-publisher**: Simple html file with a form to submit data to `feel-covid-backend`. It also parses data from the URL generated by `feel-covid-moh-data-collector`.
